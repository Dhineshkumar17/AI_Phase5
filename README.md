# AI_Phase5or patterns that should trigger that response. This is done by using regular expressions or simple string matching. For example:
    - If the user's input contains "hello," "hi," or "hey," trigger a greeting response.
    - If the user's input contains "joke," respond with a joke.

# 3. Create the Chatbot Logic:
    - Implement the chatbot's logic in Python. This logic should include:
    - Input processing: Parse the user's input to extract relevant words and information.
    - Response selection: Determine which predefined response to provide based on the recognized keywords or patterns.
    - Generate the response: Once the response is selected, generate the appropriate text to send back to the user.

# 4. User Interaction:
    - Implement a loop that allows the user to interact with the chatbot. The chatbot listens to user input, processes it, selects a response, and provides the response.

# 5. Testing and Iteration:
    - Test your chatbot with various inputs to ensure it responds correctly to different user interactions. Iterate on your responses and recognized keywords to make the chatbot more robust and user-friendly.

# 6. Deployment:
    - Once your chatbot is working as expected, you can deploy it as a command-line tool, integrate it into a web application, or deploy it on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger or Slack.

# No Specific Dataset Required:
    - Unlike machine learning-based chatbots, rule-based chatbots don't require a specific dataset for training. Instead, they rely on predefined rules and patterns to generate responses.
    - However, you can continually refine and extend your predefined responses and keywords based on user interactions and feedback to make your chatbot more capable and responsive.
